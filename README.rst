*Colorize terminal tabs automatically based on which server you are logged in. No need to preconfigure servers - the color is calculated from the hostname*


Oh my ZSH
----------------------

As of December 14, 2012, an attempt to merge the code with the `Oh my zsh <https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh>`_ code started, due to the 
enormous amount of plugins readily available for the latter project. The goal is to merge the both projects into something where the startup
files could be automatically compiled and catenated for superfast startup as is done for the ztanesh currently, while enabling the drop-in 
use of Oh my zsh plugins and themes.

Features
------------

* **Colorize** terminal tabs based on SSH connection. Each server automatically gets its own color. (iTerm2, KDE)

* **No need for cd**: just type in the directory name on the command prompt to enter into it. Cdable environment variables for fast navigation.

* Double-tap TAB for **autocompletion menu with arrow navigation**. Type ./ [TAB] to
  start file explorer in the current folder. Press space to advance the next folder.
  Press backspace to undo the selection.

* **Autocompletion for remote server commands** like *svn*, *scp*

* **Typo correction** when autocompleting: wrong case, mispelt character, etc.

* **Improved prompt readability**: bold text by default, timestamps, user, server name and smart current working directory indicator

* Turn on colored output for tools like *less* and *grep* 

* **Improved ls output colors**

* Settings files are preprocessed for **fast shell start-up**

* **Mouse support on command line**; press alt-m (meta-m) to toggle mouse mode and 
  enable position text edit cursor with the mouse 

* **Forward- and backward moving in directories stack** using alt+left/right arrows (Linux only)

* **Support for Mac standard edit keys**: *alt+arrow* to move between words. *fn+arrow*
  to go to the beginning and end of the line
  
* **Automatic update** via Github. Global (across machines, autoupdated) and local (macine specific) .rc settings files

* **Over ten years** of running in production experience

Installation
----------------

The installation instructions are based on the assumption you checkout Git repository under *~/tools* folder
in your home directory.

ZSH versions
++++++++++++++++

We recommend using `ZSH 5.0 <http://sourceforge.net/projects/zsh/files/>`_ which is the latest stable version.
As the writing of this most operating systems ship with older versions.

Ubuntu
++++++

Ubuntu install commands::

    sudo apt-get install git-core highlight zsh perl
    git clone git://github.com/miohtama/ztanesh.git ~/tools
    ~/tools/zsh-scripts/setup.zsh

Test that ZSH starts properly::

    zsh

Then activat zsh for your user by default::

  chsh -s /bin/zsh $USER

... or for the other users::

    sudo usermod -s /bin/zsh TARGETUSERNAME

Gentoo
+++++++

Gentoo Linux install commands::

    sudo emerge -av git highlight zsh
    git clone git://github.com/miohtama/ztanesh.git ~/tools
    ~/tools/zsh-scripts/setup.zsh

Test that ZSH starts properly::

    zsh

Then activat zsh for your user by default::

  chsh -s /bin/zsh $USER

... or for the other users::

    sudo usermod -s /bin/zsh TARGETUSERNAME


OSX
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Install `GNU userland tools <http://opensourcehacker.com/2012/04/27/python-and-javascript-developer-setup-hints-for-osx-lion/>`_ using
`Macports <http://macports.org>`_::

    # Note: zsh-devel installs the version 5.0 of zsh shell (latest stable)
    sudo port install zsh-devel perl5 coreutils lesspipe findutils highlight grep +with_default_names

Or use `Homebrew <http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/>`_::

    brew install zsh coreutils lesspipe findutils highlight
    # Note: you might have to edit the zsh brew formula if it shows "Error: Download failed: http://www.zsh.org/pub/zsh-5.0.0.tar.bz2"
    # brew edit zsh
    # then change: url 'http://www.zsh.org/pub/zsh-5.0.2.tar.bz2' => url 'http://sourceforge.net/projects/zsh/files/zsh/5.0.0/zsh-5.0.0.tar.bz2'

Clone ztanesh:: 

    git clone git://github.com/miohtama/ztanesh.git ~/tools
    ~/tools/zsh-scripts/setup.zsh

Test that ZSH starts properly::

    zsh

Then you MIGHT want to `fix locales for OSX <http://const-cast.blogspot.com/2009/04/mercurial-on-mac-os-x-valueerror.html>`_::

    # Fix missing locale environment variables on OSX
    # XXX: Is this problem with every OSX install or just me?
    echo "" > ~/.zsh-local/rc/locales
    echo "export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8" >> ~/.zsh-local/rc/locales
    echo "export LANG=en_US.UTF-8" >> ~/.zsh-local/rc/locales
    comprc

Activate zsh for your user account as the default shell::

    sudo dscl . -create /Users/YOURUSERNAME UserShell /opt/local/bin/zsh
    # or if you use Homebrew before: sudo dscl . -create /Users/YOURUSERNAME UserShell /usr/local/bin/zsh 

Other 'NIX operating systems
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Other UNIX flavour operating systems should work just fine. Please adjust the installation
commands according to your distribution and `report back to us how you did it <https://github.com/miohtama/ztanesh/issues>`_.

Autoupdate notes
++++++++++++++++++

If you want to autoupdate deploy your own global ZSH rc changes fork this repository on Github under your own user account, or 
set up your own private fork on anywhere you want. The authors are less benevolent dictators 
(read: BOFHs) of this project and may feel to change the scripts breaking everything for you any day.

But you can also feel free to hack this project into pieces. If you find good patches
just make Pull request on Github.

Usage
-------------

Misc tips
+++++++++++++++++++++++

* See various aliases

* Use CTRL+R to search shared ZSH history

Editing global settings 
+++++++++++++++++++++++

ZtaneSH scripts are located in ``~/tools/zsh-scripts/rc`` folder. They are 
processed pretty much like ``init.d`` scripts (loaded in number prefix order).

Edit these source scripts.
Then run ``comprc``. This will update ``~/tools/zsh-scripts/var/compiled/allrcs`` file.
This file is optimized ZSH script output and loaded on every start up.

Push your changes to Github.

Editing local settings
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Put your local settings to ``~/.zsh-local/rc``
and run ``comprc`` alias to make them effective for the next zsh startup.
